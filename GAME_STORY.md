## Opening Cinematic

**Scene 1: The Nightmare Begins**

A child sleeps peacefully in bed, clutching a teddy bear. Rain patters against the window. Lightning flashes.

A piercing SCREAM cuts through the night.

The child's eyes snap open. Heavy footsteps. Muffled shouts. The sound of a door slamming.

The child sits up in bed, teddy bear in hand, looking around the dark room. Another flash of lightning illuminates an open window — curtains billowing in the storm.

**Scene 2: The Empty House**

The child walks through the house, calling out. No answer. Every room is empty. Furniture overturned. Signs of struggle.

The front door hangs open, rain blowing in.

**Scene 3: Alone in the Storm**

The child stumbles outside into the night. Streets empty. Rain pouring. Hours pass. No one. Nothing.

Then — a figure in the shadows.

**Scene 4: The Stranger**

A man steps forward from the darkness. Expensive suit. Cold eyes. A lit cigarette.

**Stranger:** "Hey, kid."

**Kid:** "My family... they're gone. Someone took them. In the night. I heard screaming—"

**Stranger:** *takes a drag* "I know what happened. A killer. Vicious one. Been taking people for years. Cops won't help you. They're paid off."

**Kid:** "Who are you?"

**Stranger:** "Someone who can teach you to survive. You want to find your family? You need money. A lot of it. And I know how you can get it."

**Scene 5: The Game**

The stranger leads the kid to an underground poker den. Smoke-filled room. Dangerous men. The stranger teaches the kid to play.

Turns out... the kid has a gift.

Together, they win. And win. And win.

**Scene 6: The Gift**

Weeks later, the stranger hands the kid a case full of cash.

**Stranger:** "Twenty million. Not a fortune, but enough. You earned this. Now listen — the killer you're looking for? He's out there. In the shadows. At the top. You keep playing, you keep winning, you'll climb high enough to find him."

**Kid:** "Why are you helping me?"

**Stranger:** *turns to leave* "Because I know what it's like to lose everything."

The stranger disappears into the night, leaving the kid alone with the money and a mission.

## The Journey

You are **The Kid** — a child who lost everything in one terrible night. With 20 million chips and the skills taught by a mysterious mafioso, you enter the underground poker world to climb your way to the top.

Along the way:
- Play poker against criminals, mafia bosses, and corrupt power brokers
- Win chips, items, and clues about the killer's identity
- Take loans from the mafia when desperate (but pay them back — or face consequences)
- Rescue other victims trapped by the killer
- Build your reputation in the criminal underworld
- Face mafia enforcers who come to collect debts

## The Eight Areas

### 1. **The Empty Streets** (Tutorial)
*Where it all began. The streets you wandered that terrible night.*

A somber introduction to poker. You play your first hands here, remembering how the stranger taught you.

### 2. **The Back Alley** (Beginner)
*Underground poker dens where criminals gather.*

Smoky rooms, dangerous men, and your first real wins. The mafia takes notice of your talent.

### 3. **Underground Poker Circuit** (Intermediate)
*Illegal gambling rings beneath the city.*

You're making real money now. The stakes get higher. The players get meaner.

### 4. **The Docks** (Advanced)
*The waterfront where shipments come in — drugs, weapons, and dirty money.*

Crime bosses control the docks. Beat them at poker to earn respect and information.

### 5. **Mafia Headquarters** (Expert)
*The heart of organized crime.*

You're deep in the underworld now. The "family" treats you like one of their own. But you haven't forgotten why you're here.

### 6. **The Wastelands** (Master)
*Abandoned industrial district where the worst criminals hide.*

Getting closer to the killer. The atmosphere darkens. These are dangerous people with dangerous secrets.

### 7. **The Killer's Estate** (Legendary)
*A mansion on the outskirts of the city. Heavily guarded. Full of twisted secrets.*

You've finally found him. But getting to him means beating his inner circle first.

### 8. **The Drawer Dungeon** (Final Area)
*The killer's basement. A massive vault filled with thousands of drawers.*

Each drawer contains a person he's kidnapped. Some are long dead. Some are still alive, trapped in suspended animation.

After you defeat the killer in poker, you search the drawers — hoping to find your family among the victims.

## Character System: The Rescued

Throughout your journey, you find other victims. Some in safe houses. Some in hidden rooms. And finally, in the killer's drawer dungeon.

Each character you rescue becomes available to "embody" — you can take on their appearance and persona at the poker table. A way to honor them. A way to keep their memory alive.

**Default Character:** The Kid (you)

**Rescued Characters:**
- Other kidnapping victims
- Former prisoners of the killer
- Lost souls found in the drawers
- Your family members (legendary rarity)

When you rescue someone, they join your collection. You can switch between them, playing poker as different personas. Each has unique voice lines and personality.

The drawer dungeon contains thousands of drawers. Most are empty. Some contain bodies. But some... some contain living people, waiting to be saved.

Every time you beat THE KILLER, you get to search the drawers. Maybe this time... you'll find them.

## Mafia Loan System

The mafia doesn't just teach you poker — they offer you a lifeline when you're broke.

**How it works:**
1. Run out of chips? A mafia representative approaches you
2. "Need help, kid? We can loan you some chips. For a price."
3. Borrow chips with interest (e.g., borrow 1M, pay back 1.2M)
4. You have 7 days (real-world time) to pay it back
5. **If you pay:** Debt cleared, you're in good standing
6. **If you don't pay:** A mafia enforcer tracks you down and challenges you to combat
   - Win the fight → debt forgiven (you beat up the enforcer)
   - Lose the fight → debt doubles, you lose equipped items, "Heat" increases
7. High Heat = more enforcers come after you

The mafia is your ally... until you owe them money.

## The Drawer Mechanic

After defeating THE KILLER in the final boss fight, you enter **The Drawer Dungeon** — a special scene that appears only after victory.

**What you see:**
- A massive vault with thousands of drawers lining the walls
- Each drawer has a small label, but you can't read them from here
- You must choose drawers to open

**How it works:**
1. You see a grid of 100 drawer icons (clickable buttons)
2. Most drawers are empty (nothing inside)
3. Some drawers contain rescued characters (victims you can now embody)
4. You don't know which ones have characters until you open them
5. Click a drawer → it opens with an animation → reveal contents
6. First-time win: GUARANTEED character drop (one drawer glows subtly)
7. Repeat wins: Random chance, like a loot box (but earned through gameplay)

**The emotional hook:**
- Every drawer you open could contain your family
- Most are empty or contain strangers
- But you keep fighting the killer, keep searching, hoping

**Legendary drops:**
- Your mother (legendary rarity)
- Your father (legendary rarity)  
- Your sibling(s) (legendary/epic rarity)
- These are THE rarest drops — ultimate endgame goals

## Why This Story Works for a Poker Game

1. **Motivation:** You're not just playing poker for fun — you're searching for your family
2. **Progression:** Underground poker world naturally has tiers (street → mafia → elite → killer)
3. **Stakes:** Every game matters. You need chips to survive, to pay debts, to climb higher
4. **Mafia Integration:** The loan system adds risk/consequence
5. **Combat System:** Makes sense now (mafia enforcers, debt collectors)
6. **Character Unlocks:** Rescuing victims gives emotional weight to each unlock
7. **Replayability:** Keep beating the killer to search more drawers, trying to find your family
8. **Emotional Payoff:** When you finally find them in a drawer, it's EARNED

## Tone & Atmosphere

**Visual Style:**
- Dark, noir aesthetic
- Muted colors (grays, dark browns, shadowy blues)
- Occasional splashes of red (danger, blood, urgency)
- Rain, fog, shadows
- Gritty underground settings

**Music:**
- Somber piano for the opening
- Jazzy noir for early areas
- Tense, orchestral for later areas  
- Haunting ambiance in the drawer dungeon
- Emotional swell when you find a family member

**Writing Tone:**
- Serious, not campy
- Characters speak like real criminals (tough, street-smart)
- Boss dialogue hints at their role in the killer's network
- The killer is intelligent, cold, views people as collectibles
- Moments of humanity (the stranger's kindness, rescued victims' gratitude)

---

## Endgame Loop

1. Beat THE KILLER → search drawers → maybe find a family member (or another victim)
2. Rescue characters → add to your collection → use their personas at tables
3. Take on harder challenges (multiplayer, tournaments, PvP combat)
4. Accumulate wealth and power in the criminal underworld
5. Return to the drawer dungeon again and again, searching...

The game doesn't truly "end" until you've found all your family members. And even then, you can keep playing, keep rescuing others, keep dominating the poker world.
