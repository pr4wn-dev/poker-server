# Cerberus Evolution Plan

**Goal**: Transform the system into Cerberus - an AI-first three-headed guardian where the AI sees everything, knows everything, and acts on everything automatically.

**Philosophy**: Don't fix broken patterns. Build correct patterns from the start. Replace broken systems with better ones.

**Cerberus** - The three-headed guard dog of Hades, now guarding your poker server. No error escapes. Nothing gets past.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ⚠️ What's Fundamentally Broken (Will Be REPLACED)

1. **Dual State Management** ❌
   - Current: State in script variables AND files
   - Problem: Inevitable sync issues, race conditions, stale data
   - **Solution**: Single source of truth (StateStore) - **REPLACED**

2. **Reactive Detection** ❌
   - Current: Wait for errors in logs, then react
   - Problem: Misses issues that don't log, too late when detected
   - **Solution**: Proactive state verification - **REPLACED**

3. **File-Based Communication** ❌
   - Current: Write JSON files, poll for changes
   - Problem: Slow, race conditions, no real-time updates
   - **Solution**: Event-driven communication - **REPLACED**

4. **Investigation System** ❌
   - Current: Complex state across files and variables, gets stuck
   - Problem: Can get into invalid states, hard to debug
   - **Solution**: Explicit state machine with enforced transitions - **REPLACED**

5. **Pattern Matching Only** ❌
   - Current: Regex patterns to find errors
   - Problem: Fragile, misses variations, false positives
   - **Solution**: Multiple detection methods (state verification, patterns, anomalies, causal) - **REPLACED**

6. **Blocking Operations** ❌
   - Current: Some operations block monitor loop
   - Problem: Monitor can hang, poor responsiveness
   - **Solution**: Fully async architecture - **REPLACED**

### ✅ What Works (Will Be PRESERVED)

1. **Unity Management** - Auto-start/restart, pause/resume - **PRESERVED**
2. **Service Management** - Server/database auto-start/restart - **PRESERVED**
3. **File Operations** - Basic file reading/writing - **PRESERVED** (but enhanced)
4. **Modes** - Simulation mode, normal mode - **PRESERVED**
5. **Automation** - All automation features - **PRESERVED**

---

## 🎯 Evolution Strategy

**Principle**: Replace broken systems with correct-by-design systems. Don't patch, rebuild.

**Approach**: 
1. Build new AI-first system alongside old system
2. Run both in parallel to verify new system works
3. Gradually migrate functionality
4. Replace old system completely
