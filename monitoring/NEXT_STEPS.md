## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **1. Final Testing and Polish** 🟢 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Why**: System is production ready, just needs final verification
**What**:
- [ ] Final end-to-end testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation polish
- [ ] Verify all integrations working

**Impact**: System fully verified and polished
**Time**: 1-2 hours

---

### **2. Unity State Reporting** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Why**: Enable UI/audio state verification
**What**:
- [ ] Create Unity C# script for state reporting
- [ ] Report UI element states (labels, images, sounds)
- [ ] Send to server via Socket.IO
- [ ] Enable visual/audio state verification

**Impact**: Can detect UI/audio issues proactively
**Time**: 6-8 hours

---

### **3. Enhanced Detection Methods** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Why**: Add more detection capabilities
**What**:
- [ ] State verification contracts
- [ ] Dependency graph
- [ ] Enhanced anomaly detection
- [ ] Causal analysis improvements

**Impact**: More comprehensive issue detection
**Time**: 8-10 hours

---

### **4. Auto-Fix System** 🟢 **LOW PRIORITY** (But Important)
**Why**: Automatically try fixes
**What**:
- [ ] Auto-fix engine
- [ ] Integration with monitoring
- [ ] Learning system enhancements

**Impact**: System can fix issues automatically
**Time**: 10-12 hours
