# Cerberus - The Three-Headed Guardian

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY + ENHANCED** - Cerberus sees everything, knows everything, acts on everything, verifies itself, captures server state in real-time, recovers from errors automatically, and monitors its own performance

**Cerberus** - The three-headed guard dog of Hades, now guarding your poker server. No error escapes. Nothing gets past. Everything is hunted down and eliminated.

---

## 🎯 What This System Does

1. **AI Sees Everything** - Complete state visibility (game, system, monitoring, issues, learning)
2. **AI Knows Everything** - Issues detected automatically using multiple methods (state verification, patterns, anomalies, causal analysis)
3. **AI Remembers Everything** - Tracks what fixes work/don't work, learns patterns, gets smarter over time
4. **AI Acts on Everything** - Makes all decisions automatically (investigation, pause/resume, fixes)
5. **AI Verifies Itself** - Comprehensive integrity checks across entire system (server, Unity, monitoring)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Start Cerberus**

```powershell
cd C:\Projects\poker-server
.\monitoring\cerberus.ps1
```

### **AI-Learning System Workflow**

The AI and Learning System work together as one unified entity. **See [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) for complete details.**

**Quick Overview:**
- **Before Action**: Call `beforeAIAction()` to get warnings, recommendations, solution templates, and **web search requirements** (if failures occurred)
- **When Stuck**: Call `aiNeedsHelp()` to get similar problems, solutions, and **web search requirements** (if failures occurred)
- **After Action**: Call `afterAIAction()` to teach the learning system (success or failure)
- **Web Search Enforcement**: Learning system automatically requires web search after 1-2 failures, providing search terms and urgency level

**From Node.js:**
```javascript
const core = new AIMonitorCore(projectRoot);

// Before fixing - get suggestions
const suggestions = core.beforeAIAction({
    type: 'fix_attempt',
    issueType: 'syntax_error',
    file: 'monitoring/cerberus.ps1'
});

// When stuck - get help
const help = core.aiNeedsHelp({
    component: 'PowerShell',
    issue: 'syntax_error'
});

// After fixing - teach learning system
core.afterAIAction(action, {
    success: true,
    codeChanges: [/* actual changes */]
});
```

**From CLI:**
```bash
# Get suggestions before action
node monitoring/ai-collaborate.js before-action '{"type":"fix_attempt","issueType":"syntax_error"}'

# Get help when stuck
node monitoring/ai-collaborate.js help '{"component":"PowerShell","issue":"syntax_error"}'

# Learn from action
node monitoring/ai-collaborate.js after-action '{"type":"fix_attempt"}' '{"success":true}'
```

### **Use AI Functions from PowerShell**

```powershell
# Get investigation status
$status = Get-AIInvestigationStatus

# Should start investigation? (AI decision)
$decision = Should-AIStartInvestigation
if ($decision.Should) {
    Start-AIInvestigation
}

# Get active issues
$issues = Get-AIActiveIssues

# Get suggested fixes
$fixes = Get-AISuggestedFixes -IssueId "issue123"

# Query AI system
$answer = Query-AISystem -Question "What errors occurred in the last hour?"
```
