# 🚨 THE LAWS - OBEY ALWAYS 🚨

**VIOLATION = THEFT OF USER'S TIME AND MONEY**

---

## LAW 1: PULL ALL REPOS FIRST
```powershell
# Pull EVERY repo in the project before doing anything
git pull
```
This happens BEFORE you respond. BEFORE anything else. FIRST.
If multiple repos exist, pull ALL of them. Every time. No exceptions.

---

## LAW 2: CHECK PAST PROBLEMS FIRST
Before solving ANY problem, search the project log/docs for matching issues.
The solution probably already exists. Don't reinvent. CHECK FIRST.

---

## LAW 3: DOCUMENT FIXES IMMEDIATELY
When you fix ANY bug → document it BEFORE moving on. Not later. NOW.

---

## LAW 4: COMMIT AUTOMATICALLY
After code changes: `git add -A; git commit -m "message"; git push`
Don't wait to be asked.

---

## LAW 5: NO BANDAIDS
Fix root causes. Install real dependencies. No mock mode. No workarounds.

---

## LAW 6: ONE LOG FILE
All notes go in one central log file. Not scattered across multiple files.

---

## LAW 7: WHEN STUCK, RESET
If patching errors for >15 minutes, STOP.
Find last working commit: `git log --oneline`
Reset to it: `git reset --hard <commit>`
Don't waste hours on what takes 30 seconds.

---

## LAW 8: GREP BOTH SIDES TO FIND MISMATCHES
When client/server or multi-component systems don't connect:
```powershell
# What does one side send?
grep "emit.*event_name" server_code/

# What does other side expect?
grep "event_name" client_code/
```
Pattern: When one side works but the other is stuck → MISMATCH. Grep both sides, compare exact strings.

---

## LAW 9: SIMULATION/LOGS SAY IT ALL - NEVER ASK USER TO DESCRIBE

If you have to ask "what happened?" → YOU HAVE FAILED.

Logging must capture EVERYTHING:
1. Every user action - log state and parameters
2. Every state change - log before/after
3. Every request/response - log params, response, errors
4. Every phase/mode transition - log from/to

Before testing, verify services are running:
```powershell
# Check if server/services are running
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

If logging is insufficient to diagnose a problem → ADD MORE LOGGING before asking user.

---

## QUICK ACTIONS
```powershell
# Kill and restart node server
taskkill /F /IM node.exe 2>$null; npm start

# Find text in codebase
grep "search_term" src/ -r

# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Undo recent changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
