# 🚨 THE LAWS - OBEY ALWAYS 🚨

**VIOLATION = THEFT OF USER'S TIME AND MONEY**

---

## LAW 1: PULL BOTH REPOS FIRST
```powershell
cd C:\Projects\poker-server; git pull
cd C:\Projects\poker-client-unity; git pull
```
This happens BEFORE you respond. BEFORE anything else. FIRST.
Not one. BOTH. Every time. No exceptions.

---

## LAW 2: CHECK PAST PROBLEMS FIRST
Before solving ANY problem, search INSTALL_LOG.md for matching issues.
The solution probably already exists. Don't reinvent. CHECK FIRST.

---

## LAW 3: DOCUMENT FIXES IMMEDIATELY
When you fix ANY bug → add it to INSTALL_LOG.md BEFORE moving on.

---

## LAW 4: COMMIT AUTOMATICALLY
After code changes: `git add -A; git commit -m "message"; git push`
Don't wait to be asked.

---

## LAW 5: NO BANDAIDS
Fix root causes. Install real dependencies. No mock mode. No workarounds.

---

## LAW 6: ONE LOG FILE
All notes go in INSTALL_LOG.md. Not in separate files.

---

## LAW 7: WHEN STUCK, RESET
If patching errors for >15 minutes, STOP.
Find last working commit: `git log --oneline`
Reset to it: `git reset --hard <commit>`

---

## LAW 8: GREP BOTH SIDES TO FIND MISMATCHES
When client/server mismatch:
```powershell
# What does server emit?
grep "socket.emit.*event_name" src/sockets/SocketHandler.js

# What does client expect?
grep "eventName" Assets/Scripts/Networking/SocketManager.cs
```

---

## LAW 9: SIMULATION SAYS IT ALL - NEVER ASK USER TO DESCRIBE

If you have to ask "what happened?" → YOU HAVE FAILED.

The simulation must capture EVERYTHING:
1. Every button click - log state and parameters
2. Every state change - log before/after
3. Every server request - log params, response, errors
4. Every phase transition - log from/to, player counts

Before testing, verify server is running:
```powershell
Get-Content "c:\Users\megap\.cursor\projects\c-Projects-Workspaces-poker-server-code-workspace\terminals\*.txt" -Tail 5
```

If logging is insufficient → ADD MORE LOGGING before asking user.

- **Server repo:** C:\Projects\poker-server
- **Client repo:** C:\Projects\poker-client-unity
- **Main log:** INSTALL_LOG.md
