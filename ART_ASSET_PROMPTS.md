# Art Asset Prompts - Image Generation Guide

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use prompts for free AI image generators (Grok Imagine, Bing Image Creator, Leonardo AI, etc.)  
**Style target:** Dark, stylized urban aesthetic. GTA meets poker. Gritty to glam progression.  
**Format:** All game assets should be PNG with transparent backgrounds unless noted otherwise.

---

## Style Reference (include in every prompt)

Add this to the end of any prompt to keep the style consistent:

> "Dark stylized digital art, urban underground aesthetic, moody lighting, muted colors with gold/amber accents, semi-realistic style, suitable for a mobile game UI, clean edges, high contrast against dark backgrounds"

For area-specific art, swap the mood keywords:
- **Area 1 (The Dirty Lew):** "gritty urban, dimly lit, worn textures, street-level, flickering neon"
- **Late areas (high-end):** "luxurious, clean lines, deep blacks, bright gold, exclusive VIP feel"

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Transparent backgrounds**: Always request "transparent background" for icons and UI elements. If the generator doesn't support it, use https://remove.bg (free) to remove backgrounds after.

2. **Consistency**: Always include the style reference line at the end of prompts to keep everything looking like it belongs in the same game.

3. **Batch similar items**: Generate all bosses in one session, all vehicles in one session, etc. Generators tend to keep style more consistent within a session.

4. **Resolution**: Request high resolution when possible. For mobile game assets:
   - Backgrounds: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Character portraits: 512x512 or 1024x1024
   - Item icons: 256x256 or 512x512
   - UI elements: 256x256 or as needed

5. **Iteration**: First generation rarely nails it. Use the best result as a reference image for the next attempt with adjusted prompts.

6. **Free generators that work well:**
   - **Grok Imagine** (X/Twitter) - good quality, no watermarks
   - **Bing Image Creator** (Microsoft) - DALL-E 3, free, high quality
   - **Leonardo AI** - free tier, great for game assets specifically
   - **Ideogram** - good with text in images if needed for logos
   - **Playground AI** - free daily generations, good for UI elements

7. **For animated card backs**: Generate 3-4 frames with the shimmer at different positions, then use them as a sprite sheet animation in Unity (cycle through frames at ~4-8 FPS for a smooth shimmer).
