# Art Asset Prompts — AI Image Generation Guide

**Purpose:** Ready-to-use prompts for free AI image generators (Grok Imagine, Bing Image Creator, Leonardo AI, etc.)  
**Style target:** Dark, gritty underground poker meets Wild West showdowns. Crime-world poker with escalating stakes — from back-alley card games to penthouse high-stakes tables. Think GTA's criminal underworld + Red Dead Redemption saloon vibes + modern poker.  
**Format:** All game assets should be PNG with transparent backgrounds unless noted otherwise.

**Last updated:** Feb 14, 2026

## Style Reference (include in every prompt)

Add this to the end of any prompt to keep the style consistent:

> "Dark stylized digital art, underground crime-world poker aesthetic, moody dramatic lighting, muted colors with gold/amber/crimson accents, semi-realistic stylized art, suitable for a mobile game UI, clean edges, high contrast against dark backgrounds"

For area-specific art, swap the mood keywords:
- **Early areas (Poker Academy, Downtown):** "gritty urban, dimly lit, worn textures, street-level, flickering bar signs"
- **Mid areas (Highrise, Underground):** "industrial noir, exposed pipes, caged lights, smoke-filled, tension"
- **Late areas (Yacht, Island, Penthouse):** "luxurious, clean lines, deep blacks, bright gold, exclusive VIP feel"
- **Combat scenes:** "Wild West showdown mood, tense standoff, dramatic backlighting, dust particles"

## GENERATION TIPS

1. **Transparent backgrounds**: Always request "transparent background" for icons and UI elements. If the generator doesn't support it, use https://remove.bg (free) to remove backgrounds after.

2. **Consistency**: Always include the style reference line at the end of prompts to keep everything looking like it belongs in the same game.

3. **Batch similar items**: Generate all weapons in one session, all armor in one session, all bosses in one session, etc. Generators keep style more consistent within a session.

4. **Resolution**: Request high resolution when possible:
   - Backgrounds: 1920x1080 or higher
   - Character portraits: 1024x1024
   - Boss portraits: 512x512 or 1024x1024
   - Item icons: 256x256 or 512x512
   - UI elements: 128x128 to 256x256
   - Card backs: 750x1050

5. **Iteration**: First generation rarely nails it. Use the best result as a reference image for the next attempt with adjusted prompts.

6. **Free generators that work well:**
   - **Grok Imagine** (X/Twitter) — good quality, no watermarks
   - **Bing Image Creator** (Microsoft) — DALL-E 3, free, high quality
   - **Leonardo AI** — free tier, great for game assets specifically
   - **Ideogram** — good with text in images if needed for logos
   - **Playground AI** — free daily generations, good for UI elements

7. **For animated card backs**: Generate 3-4 frames with a shimmer at different positions, then use them as a sprite sheet animation in Unity (cycle through frames at ~4-8 FPS for a smooth shimmer).
